# Coding workshop

Getting started:

Installing the Arduino IDE
The first step that needs to be completed before  any coding can be done is to set up the correct environment. Since we will primarily be using Arduino boards to program our robots, it is ideal for us to develop in the Arduino IDE. IDE is short for Integrated Development Environment, which contains not only the text editor need to write our code  in, but also a compiler to build our code, and communication protocols with the chip that we are programming. Arduino boards are small boards that contain a microcontroller and easy to use interfaces for programming the processor and using it to control electronics. Follow the steps below  to get the Arduino IDE installed:

1.  Head to http://arduino.cc/en/Main/Software to access the download page

2.  Download your appropriate installer, depending on what operating system your machine has.

4.  Run the installer, and leave  all options in their default states. Note: On Windows, you will get a pop up asking to install  the Arduino USB Driver. This is very important, so click allow.

5.  Once the  install finishes, close  the installer, and you  should have the Arduino IDE
installed on your computer!
