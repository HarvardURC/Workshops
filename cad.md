# Computer Aided Design with SOLIDWORKS

In this workshop you will learn the basics of CAD (computer aided design) and modeling 3D objects in SOLIDWORKS. You will start using SOLIDWORKS'own tutorials, which we find do a pretty good job of introducing basic methods and techniques. Once you've completed the SOLIDWORKS tutorials, you will have a chance to practice building a real part, which you may actually end up using in your line-following robot for the comp!

## Starting Tutorials

1. Open SolidWorks by clicking on the appropriate icon on the desktop.
2. On the menu bar, open Help -> Tutorials.
3. Click "Introduction to SOLIDWORKS" and follow the tutorial's instructions to learn how to model parts and create drawings.

## Modeling a Real Part

For our comp, you'll be asked to build a line following robot using [this chassis](https://www.pololu.com/product/61) and [this reflectance sensor](https://www.pololu.com/product/2456). To mount the sensor to the chassis, we've designed a laser-cut acrylic sensor mount that attaches the sensor to the front of the chassis and allows its height to be adjusted. You can find a dimensioned drawing for the sensor mount [here](https://github.com/HarvardURC/Workshops/blob/master/assets/cad/Sensor%20Mount%20Dimensioned.PDF). All parts are made from 0.125" acrylic.

The parts are aligned by tabs and slots and held together by 4-40 screws and square nuts pressed into the acrylic. To avoid redrawing the tabs and slots on each part, you can use the provided Sketch Blocks ([tabs](https://github.com/HarvardURC/Workshops/blob/master/assets/cad/4-40%20t-slot.SLDBLK), [slots](https://github.com/HarvardURC/Workshops/blob/master/assets/cad/4-40%20Slot.SLDBLK)). Download the files and put them in the same folder as your other project files. To insert them in a sketch, drag and drop them into SOLIDWORKS from File Explorer and click the check in the dialog that pops up. The blocks may then be dragged and constrained like regular geometry.

As CAD practice, model the parts for the sensor mounts and create an Assembly of the sensor mount. Show the file to one of the HURC members when you've finished.

If you need help, ask one of the HURC members.
